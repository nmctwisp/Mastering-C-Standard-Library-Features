/*
RESOURCE AND "UNIQUE OWNERSHIP"
-------------------------------
- Every "resource" needs to be acquired and then released
- Dynamic memory, files, and threads are all examples of resources
- "Unique Ownership": there is a single owner of a particular resource, who
is responsible both for its acquisition and release.
- Access to the resource is only possible through its owner.
